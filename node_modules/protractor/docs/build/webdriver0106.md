##[webdriver.Key.chord](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/javascript/webdriver/webdriver.js#1418)

Simulate pressing many keys at once in a "chord". Takes a sequence of
{@link webdriver.Key}s or strings, appends each of the values to a string,
and adds the chord termination key ({@link webdriver.Key.NULL}) and returns
the resultant string.

Note: when the low-level webdriver key handlers see Keys.NULL, active
modifier keys (CTRL/ALT/SHIFT/etc) release via a keyup event.
