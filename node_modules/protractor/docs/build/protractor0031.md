##[Protractor.prototype.debugger](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/lib/protractor.js#L900)

Pauses the test and injects some helper functions into the browser, so that
debugging may be done in the browser console.

This should be used under node in debug mode, i.e. with
protractor debug <configuration.js>

While in the debugger, commands can be scheduled through webdriver by
entering the repl:
  debug> repl
  Press Ctrl + C to leave rdebug repl
  > ptor.findElement(protractor.By.input('user').sendKeys('Laura'));
  > ptor.debugger();
  debug> c

This will run the sendKeys command as the next task, then re-enter the
debugger.
