##[webdriver.WebElement.prototype.getCssValue](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/javascript/webdriver/webdriver.js#1771)

Schedules a command to query for the computed style of the element
represented by this instance. If the element inherits the named style from
its parent, the parent will be queried for its value.  Where possible, color
values will be converted to their hex representation (e.g. #00ff00 instead of
rgb(0, 255, 0)).
<p/>
<em>Warning:</em> the value returned will be as the browser interprets it, so
it may be tricky to form a proper assertion.
